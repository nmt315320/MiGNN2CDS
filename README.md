# MiGNN2CDS


1. Description
   
Circular RNAs (circRNAs) can regulate microRNA activity and are related to various diseases, such as cancer. Functional research on circRNAs is the focus of scientific research. Accurate identification of circRNAs is important for gaining insight into their functions.

We developed a novel framework, MiGNN2CDS, for predicting circRNA and drug sensitivity association. MiGNN2CDS uses four different feature encoding schemes and adopts a multilayer convolutional neural network and bidirectional long short-term memory network to learn high-order feature representation and make circRNA predictions. 

2. Availability

2.1 Datasets and source code are available at:https://github.com/nmt315320/CircDC.git.

sequence Dataï¼šcircRNA data, .bed format

hg38.fa---Because the data is relatively large, you need to download it yourself.

2.1 Local running

2.1.1 Environment

Before running, please make sure the following packages are installed in Python environment:

gensim==3.4.0

pysam

pigwig

pandas==1.1.3

tensorflow==2.3.0

python==3.7.3

biopython==1.7.8

numpy==1.19.2

For convenience, we strongly recommended users to install the Anaconda Python 3.7.3 (or above) in your local computer.

2.1.2 Additional requirements

One additional file, namely hg.38.fa, is needed for CircDC, we did not provide this in the source code packages because of the license restriction. This file can be acquired at the following links:

hg38: wget https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg38/bigZips/latest/hg38.fa.gz

3. Running

## k-fold Cross Validation
    python main.py -da {DATASET} -sp {SAVED PATH}
    Main arguments:
        -da: B-dataset C-dataset F-dataset R-dataset
        -ag: Aggregation method for bag embedding [sum, mean, Linear, BiTrans]
        -nl: The number of HeteroGCN layer
        -tk: The topk similarities in heterogeneous network construction
        -k : The topk filtering in instance predictor
        -hf: The dimension of hidden feature
        -ep: The number of epoches
        -bs: Batch size
        -lr: Learning rate
        -dp: Dropout rate
    For more arguments, please see args.py
Note: please see the optimal hyperparameter settings for each benchmark dataset, and other support information in 'supplementary materials.docx'.  

## Model Intepretebility
Use the ``model_intepret.ipynb`` to easily generate topk most important **meta-path instances** for given drug-disease pair (require **pre-trained model** first). 

3.4 Output explaining

The output file (in ".csv" format) can be found in results folder, which including sequence number, sequence_id, predicted probability and pedicted result.

3.5 SHAP

shapexample.py can be executed to analyze important features. The following methods are: shap.TreeExplainer, shap.summary_plot .
